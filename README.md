## Speed up your workflow

Sketch is our design tool of choice at Shopify. It supports the use of plugins to adapt to different kinds of workflows. While working with Polaris and Sketch, we found switching context between Sketch and polaris-icons.shopify.com distracting and time consuming.

Thatâ€™s why we created this project, a Sketch plugin that lets you search and view Polaris guidelines and code right from within Sketch.

Polaris Icons can help you:

- Search for icons and drag and drop them directly from your design environment
